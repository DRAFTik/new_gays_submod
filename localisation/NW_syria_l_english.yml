 ## EVENTS
 syria.0.t:0 "Syrian Nationalists Arrived in Paris"
 syria.0.desc:0 "Today, representatives of the National Bloc, a coalition of parties for Syria's independence from France, which is governed by the mandate entrusted to us by the League of Nations, arrived in Paris. It was given to prepare the peoples living in the territories of concern for self-government, and now Syrians believe they are ready for independence.\nHowever, dreams of building a global colonial empire are still in the hearts of French politicians - perhaps we should listen to them."
 syria.0.a:0 "We will sign the treaty, but we will ratify it later"
 syria.0.b:0 "Let's discuss all the details"
 syria.0.a_tt:0 "Of course, no one will ratify the Franco-Syrian Treaty on the Consistent Granting of Independence.\n"
 syria.0.b_tt:0 "We will start discussing the terms of the agreement, which will last for some time, during which we will define the final political situation in the Levant and give independence to Syria, which will become a colony subject.\n"
 syria.0.b_tt1:0 "§LYou will be able to start the game for §HSyria§! t the end of negotiations§!\n"
 syria.1.t:0 "France Retains the Mandate"

 syria.2.t:0 "Status of the Lebanese Republic"
 syria.2.desc:0 "Lebanon was created as a state of Christians in the Middle East, but because of the implementation of the concept of Great Lebanon, this country is now home to many Muslims. Perhaps it makes sense to include Lebanon in Syria, but there are doubts that its residents will be particularly happy."
 syria.2.a:0 "Lebanon will remain under French rule"
 syria.2.b:0 "The Republic will gain full independence"

 syria.3.t:0 "Status of the Druze State"
 syria.3.desc:0 "Religion plays a big role in relations between Arabs. It is for this reason that they have got their own state in Syria under their mandate; however, it is not economically viable - it is unlikely that they should leave it alone, otherwise it will simply become a puppet in the hands of others."
 syria.3.a:0 "The Druze state will remain independent"

 syria.4.t:0 "Status of the Alawite State"

 syria.9.a:0 "We will choose a democratic government"
 syria.9.b:0 "The people will support monarchists"
 syria.10.t:0 "Request Economic Assistance from France"
 syria.10.desc:0 "Our country is in a trash state, most of the population is either peasants or nomads. Some politicians believe that we should ask for help from France, but it seems that such a step can only enslave Syria."
 syria.10.a:0 "We have no other option"
 syria.10.b:0 "We will build an independent economy"
 syria.11.t:0 "Syria Wants to Take Credit"
 syria.11.desc:0 "It is clear that if Syria is in a very difficult situation, its economy is almost undeveloped. But we can provide economic support to the young republic - then the new state will be not only viable, but also dependent on us - the government of the republic, which has declared its desire to take a loan, is not against this option."

 syria.18.b:0 "We will have to accept... For the time being"
 syria.19.desc:0 "[From.GetName] seems to be ruled by rather cunning and insolent people - taking advantage of our weakness, the Turks entered the territory of the Sanjak of Alexandretta and incorporated it into their state, claiming that it is their integral territory. It's our colonial territory, but maybe it's worth letting them continue their aggression against Syria - it will weaken our adversary."
